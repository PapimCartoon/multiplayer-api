Notice that we have devided the game
into four parts:
1- TemplateMain  ---> handeles the entire game interaction with the server
2- TemplateLogic ---> handeles the entire game logic,meaning calculations used to determine game reactions to user input etc...
3- TemplateGraphic --->handeles the entire game graphics.
4- SomeClass ---> the classes used to transfer information between the diffrent game players

notice that this convention is only a suggestion,but it will make it easier for you to work and for us and others to help you debug your game
