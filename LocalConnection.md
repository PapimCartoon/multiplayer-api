See [Macromedia Flash - ActionScript Dictionary for LocalConnection](http://www.adobe.com/support/flash/action_scripts/actionscript_dictionary/actionscript_dictionary437.html).

The API uses LocalConnection as the channel for passing commands between the _game_ and the _container_.

LocalConnection is also the only way that AS2 and AS3 can communicate.

Therefore, both _game_ and _container_ can choose if they prefer to use AS2 or AS3.

See [the Multiplayer API Implementation](MultiplayerAPI_Implementation.md).
