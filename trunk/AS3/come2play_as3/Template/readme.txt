Notice that we have divided the game Into four main class types:
1- TemplateMain  ---> handles the entire game interaction with the server
2- TemplateLogic ---> handles the entire game logic, meaning calculations used to determine game reactions to user input etc...
3- TemplateGraphic --->handles the entire game graphics.
4- SomeClass ---> the classes used to transfer information between the different game players

Notice that this convention is only a suggestion, but it will make it easier for you to work and for us and others to help you debug your game
