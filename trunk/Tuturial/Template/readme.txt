Notice that we have divided the game Into four main class types:
1- TemplateMain  ---> handles the entire game interaction with the server
2- TemplateLogic ---> handles the entire game logic, meaning calculations used to determine game reactions to user input etc...
3- TemplateCalculatorLogic ---> handles the calculations that will be made by the calculator,in case you use one in your game.
4- TemplateGraphic --->handles the entire game graphics.
5- SomeClass ---> the classes used to transfer information between the different game players

Notice :  this convention is only a suggestion, but it will make it easier for you to work, and for us and others to help you debug your game
