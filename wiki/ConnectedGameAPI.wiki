#summary An API that converts single-player games to multiplayer

ConnectedGameAPI is used to easily convert a score-based *single-player* game to a multiplayer game.
The functions below are identical to those in [ClientGameAPI]
{{{
got_general_info(entries:Array/*Entry*/)
got_user_info(user_id:int, entries:Array/*Entry*/)
got_my_user_id(my_user_id:int)
got_match_started(all_player_ids:Array/*int*/, finished_player_ids:Array/*int*/, extra_match_info:Object/*Serializable*/, match_started_time:int, match_state:Array/*UserEntry*/)
got_match_over(finished_player_ids:Array/*int*/)
do_store_match_state(entry:Entry)
got_stored_match_state(user_entry:UserEntry)
}}}
The only two new functions are for handling the score of the single-player game:
{{{
do_connected_set_score(score:int)
do_connected_match_over(did_win:Boolean)
}}}
The `score` must be strictly higher than 0.
As the user advances, his `score` should get higher.

If you want to be able to save the game, you should store the match state occasionally.
