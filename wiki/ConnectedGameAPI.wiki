#summary An API that converts single-player games to multiplayer

ConnectedGameAPI is used to easily convert a score-based *single-player* game to a multiplayer game.
The functions below are identical to those in [ClientGameAPI]
{{{
got_general_info
got_user_info
got_my_user_id
got_match_started
got_match_over
do_store_match_state
got_stored_match_state
}}}
The only two new functions are for handling the score of the single-player game:
{{{
do_connected_set_score(score:int)
do_connected_match_over(did_win:Boolean)
}}}
The `score` must be strictly higher than 0.
As the user advances, his `score` should get higher.

If you want to be able to save the game, you should store the match state occasionally.
