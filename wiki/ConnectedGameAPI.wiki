#summary An API that converts single-player games to multiplayer

ConnectedGameAPI is used to easily convert a score-based *single-player* game to a multiplayer game.
The functions below are identical to those in [ClientGameAPI]
{{{
doStoreState(userEntries:Array/*UserEntry*/)
gotCustomInfo(infoEntries:Array/*InfoEntry*/) 
gotUserInfo(userId:int, infoEntries:Array/*InfoEntry*/)
gotMyUserId(myUserId:int)
gotStateChanged(serverEntries:Array/*ServerEntry*/) 
gotMatchEnded(finishedPlayerIds:Array/*int*/)
gotMatchStarted(allPlayerIds:Array/*int*/, finishedPlayerIds:Array/*int*/, extraMatchInfo:Object, matchStartedTime:int, serverEntries:Array/*ServerEntry*/)
}}}
The only two new functions are for handling the score of the single-player game:
{{{
doConnectedSetScore(score:int)
doConnectedEndMatch(didWin:Boolean)
}}}
The `score` must be strictly higher than 0.
As the user advances, his `score` should get higher.

If you want to be able to save the game, you should store the match state occasionally.
