#summary A summary of all error messaged you might encounter

While developing a game in the emulator toy might stumble upon a few of our custom made errors,
most of them should be self explanatory but if you still find you are having to understand them, you might refer to this page

== Error List ==



=== called do_register_on_server twice  ===

On of the clients called [doRegisterOnServer] more then once

=== doStoreState must get at least 1 UserEntry ===

Every [doStoreState] call should at least contain 1 UserEntry

=== Can't store match state, key is empty ===

You can't use a null key's to either store, pass on reveal serverEntries(don't use null keys at all)

=== There is a LocalConnection error. Please test your game only inside the Come2Play emulator. ===

If this Error happens while using the emulator, contact ofir@come2play.com for additional help.

=== (Timed out Transaction) Timed out ===

Called when a doALL call is made by only part of the users, and to much time has passed.

=== calculator sent wrong requestId ===

Called when you pass a wrong requestId to the server after processing a [doAllrequestStateCalculations]

=== can't do (MethodName) game not started ===

The server can't process messaged before the game has started.

=== (UserName)  called  (MethodName)  while (OtherUserName)  called  (OtherMethodName) ===

This is called when users called doAll's in different order

==== Example ====

If user "one" called doAllSetTurn(1,100) and then doAllRequestRandomState({type:"secretNum"})
and user "Two" called doAllRequestRandomState({type:"secretNum"}) and then  doAllSetTurn(1,100)

you'll get:

(one)  called  (doAllSetTurn)  while (two)  called  (doAllRequestRandomState)


=== To call doAllRequestStateCalculations you must enable calculators ===

If you use [doAllRequestStateCalculations] you must enable this in the emulator index page.

=== can't call a new calculation before finishing the first ===

Means you tired to call a [doAllRequestStateCalculations] before getting the calls results



=== can't do (MethodName) game ended ===

The server can't process messaged after the game has ended.
