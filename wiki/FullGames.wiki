#summary Full code examples of games using ClientGameAPI

To help you start off the creation of your game we provide you, with a few games full source code
Again like in the pseudoCode examples we provide you with one out of each category(for now not all games are made yet)
more full games will become available soon.

all the games can be found in the [Emulator] AS2 and AS3 directories.

most of the games are created for AS3 because of its ease of use and increased functionality

We give here example code of the following games.
Turn-based games:
 * Public state: [http://multiplayer-api.googlecode.com/files/EmulatorAPI-Version1.0.4.zip TicTacToe], 
 * Public state + Randomness: Backgammon, Roulette
 * Deterministic + secrets: Battleships, Startego, Diplomacy
 * Shuffles + secrets: [http://multiplayer-api.googlecode.com/files/EmulatorAPI-Version1.0.4.zip Dominoes], Black Jack, Poker, Bridge, Clue (has several shuffles)
 * Randomness + secrets: Risk, Tanks (the wind is random; the secrets are the angle & speed of each shot)
 * With calculators: [http://multiplayer-api.googlecode.com/files/EmulatorAPI-Version1.0.4.zip  Mine Sweeper] (behaves also as real Time), Sudoku  .
Real-time games:
 * Trivia: Series of questions, the player who answers correctly, first wins the question. Limit the time for all players (if no one answered, go to the next question. if you answered incorrectly, the remaining player wins the question)
 * [http://multiplayer-api.googlecode.com/files/EmulatorAPI-Version1.0.4.zip Snake]
