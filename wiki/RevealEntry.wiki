#summary RevealEntry Class
{{{
class RevealEntry{var key:String, var userIds:Array/*int*/  = null, var depth:int  = 1;}
}}}
`key` - the key of the `ServerEntry` to reveal
`userIds` - an array of user ids to reveal the `ServerEntry` to
`depth` - in case depth is greater than 1 the value of the revealed `ServerEntry` is counted as a pointer to the next `ServerEntry`.
For example if you send doAllRevealState(RevealEntry.create("guess7", null , 2))

And the server has a `ServerEntry` with the key "guess7" with the value "WrongGuess",
Then instead of getting the `ServerEntry` with the key "guess7",
You will get a `ServerEntry` with the key "WrongGuess".

The bigger the number in the depth the more times a pointer will be followed

*A pointer `ServerEntry` value must be a String.

To create a `RevealEntry` instance you must use it's create function and not a constructor:
{{{
RevealEntry.create(key, userIds, depth);
 }}}
