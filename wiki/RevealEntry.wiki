#summary RevealEntry Class
{{{
class RevealEntry{var key:String, var userIds:Array/*int*/  = null, var depth:int  = 0;}
}}}
*key :*  the key of the [ServerEntry] to reveal.

*userIds :*  an array of user ids to reveal the [ServerEntry] to.

*depth :*  in case depth is greater than 0 the value of the revealed [ServerEntry] is counted as a pointer to the key of the next [ServerEntry].

===For example:===


if you send doAllRevealState(RevealEntry.create("guess7", null , 1))

And the server has a [ServerEntry] with the key "guess7" with the value "WrongGuess",

Then instead of getting the [ServerEntry] with the key "guess7",

You will get a [ServerEntry] with the key "WrongGuess".

The bigger the number in the depth the more times the value will be used as a pointer to the next [ServerEntry] key.

*A pointer [ServerEntry] value must be a String.
