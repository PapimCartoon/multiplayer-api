#summary coding conventions for using the API effectively

= Call types =

In game development using the API, there are two kinds of calls that the developer can use

either a [doStoreState] call or a doAll call.

== doStoreState ==

This call is used to transfer any kind of data from the user to the other game clients, and the server state,
This call can be made in any part of the game, and may be triggered by user input, timers, or anything else the programmer seems fit.

It is important that all data received by the other clients that was stored using [doStoreState] will be verified thoroughly by the receiving 
game clients as to the fact that this is the most easy to fake data in the game.

== doAll calls ==

This refers to all the call starting with a doAll as a prefix, these calls must be called by the entire set of the game's players,
each with the same parameters.

In case one of the players doesn't call the doAll, or calls it with different values.
Then the rest of the players will call a [doAllFoundHacker] with his user ID, to decide if he is a hacker.

A doAll call can only be triggered by a [gotMatchStarted] , [gotStateChanged] and [gotMathEnded] callbacks,
and cannot in any circumstances be called due to user input or anything else for that matter.

= Correct Programming =

To allow several automatic features our container gives.
Such as play by play functionality and the ability to easily save and load your game at any state,
You should make sure to make changes in the game's logic only as a result of a received state change.

This may seem strange but imagine a real time game of minesweeper where both players pressed one of the mines
Almost simultaneously.
In this case both will think they found the mine and you will have inconsistency between the players.
But if you mark the mine as someone's only after the state changed callback, then both will get one of the calls first
and will mark the callback owner as the one who discovered the mine, and will disregard the second callback
