#summary Call it to end the match. The match will be over when all players called it

{{{
doAllEndMatch(finishedPlayers:Array/*PlayerMatchOver*/)
}}}


=== Description ===

Call this function to end the game for some or all players.
all the players who's ID's are in the finishedPlayers array are considered as finished players
and are treated as viewers from that point on.

see also [gotMatchEnded]

=== Parameters ===

finishedPlayers:Array - an array containing an instance of [PlayerMatchOver] for each finishing player.



=== Example ===

lets say we have a player who's id is 1, the player has a score of 50
and therefore gets 30% of the pot.
the call each of the users will make would look like this:
{{{

var playerMatchOver:PlayerMatchOver = PlayerMatchOver.create(1,50,30);
var finishingPlayers:Array = new Array();
finishingPlayers.push(playerMatchOver);
doAllEndMatch(finishingPlayers);

}}}



it is possible that only a subset of the players end the match (but in any case, all players must call `doAllEndMatch`).

Each element of the array `finishedPlayers` is of type [PlayerMatchOver]:

For example, suppose you have 3 players with `playerIds`=41, 42, 43. 

Suppose userId=42 ended the match with score 90, and he should get 20% of the pot.

Then all the players (users 41, 42, 43) should call:

{{{
  doAllEndMatch([ PlayerMatchOver.create(42, 90, 20) ])
}}}

Now users 41 and 43 continue to play, 

The match is over with the score=100 to userId=41, and score=10 to userId=43,

In addition you wish to give 90% of the pot to user 41.

In this case all players (users 41 and 43) should call:

{{{
  doAllEndMatch([ PlayerMatchOver.create(41, 100, 10) , PlayerMatchOver.create(43, 10, 10) ])
}}}
