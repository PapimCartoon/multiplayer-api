#summary Call it when a player sent an illegal message

{{{
doAllFoundHacker(userId:int, errorDescription:String)
}}}

In [ClientGameAPI] all the logic is on the client side,
Therefore the players themselves should check that the other players make only legal moves.

Both players and viewers should call `doAllFoundHacker` in case of a protocol error.

Consider a game with two players: X and Y.
Suppose that player Y stored an illegal match state.
Then player X should call `doAllFoundHacker(Y,description)`.
The server will randomly pick a jury that will judge whether
Player X or player Y is the hacker.

The jury is a set of users that are playing in another game.
The server will pass to the jury the match state, and then the final message that caused player X to call `doAllFoundHacker`.
If all members of the jury called `doAllFoundHacker`,
Then the server decides that player Y is a hacker.
If no member of the jury called `doAllFoundHacker`
Then the server decides that player X is a hacker (that falsely reported on player Y).
If the jury is in disagreement, then this is a bug of the game developer,
And the game is canceled.
