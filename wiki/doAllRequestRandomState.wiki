#summary Generating public and secret random numbers

{{{
doAllRequestRandomState(key:String, isSecret:Boolean = false)
}}}

Some of the games developed need to have random numbers, if it’s a public random number to create a dice toss
in a game of backgammon, or a secret random seed to calculate a mine sweeper game board.

If it's a public random number to create an unbiased cube toss In a game of backgammon,
Or a secret random seed to calculate a mine sweeper game board.

When the command will be processed the server will store a [ServerEntry] containing a random number in the key specepifed by the `doAllRequestRandomState call` key.
The random number value will be an integer in the range of `int.MIN_VALUE` = -2147483648 and `int.MAX_VALUE` =2147483647.

*key :*  the key the new [ServerEntry] with the random integer will have.


*isSecret :*  a Boolean which will determine if the random number generated will be a secret one. 

If isSecret is false then the new [ServerEntry] will have `authorizedUserIds` of null,
And if it’s true [ServerEntry] will have `authorizedUserIds` as an empty Array.

`storedByUserId` will be -1 because the changes were saved by the server.
