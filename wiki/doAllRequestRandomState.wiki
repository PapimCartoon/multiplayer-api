#summary Generating public and secret random numbers

{{{
doAllRequestRandomState(key:String, isSecret:Boolean = false)
}}}

Some of the games developed need to have random numbers,if its a public random number to create a cube toss
in a game of backgammon, or a secret random seed to calculate a mine sweeper game board .

If a random value is needed, all the players need to call `doAllRequestRandomState` with the
`key` the new random state will have,
and the `isSecret` Boolean which will determine if its a secret random number.
A random number is secret by default.

when the command will be processed it will send a `gotStateChanged` event containing the random number
in case a public random number was requested,
in case the number requested is secret only the key will be sent.
in any case the `storedByUserId` will be -1 because the changes were saved by the server.
