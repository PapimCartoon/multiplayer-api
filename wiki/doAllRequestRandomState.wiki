#summary Generating public and secret random numbers

{{{
doAllRequestRandomState(key:String, isSecret:Boolean = false)
}}}

Some of the games developed need to have random numbers,if its a public random number to create a dice toss
in a game of backgammon, or a secret random seed to calculate a mine sweeper game board.

If it's a public random number to create an unbiased cube toss In a game of backgammon,
The random value will be an integer in the range `int.MIN_VALUE` and `int.MAX_VALUE`.

Or a secret random seed to calculate a mine sweeper game board.


When the command will be processed it will send a `gotStateChanged` event containing the random number
if a public random number was requested.
In case the number requested is secret, the value will be null.
`storedByUserId` will be -1 because the changes were saved by the server.

*key :*  the new key the random state will have.

*isSecret :*  a Boolean which will determine if the random number generated will be a secret one.
