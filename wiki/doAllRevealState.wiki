#summary Call it to reveal a secret entry to a player. 

{{{
doAllRevealState(revealEntries:Array/*RevealEntry*/)
}}}

To reveal a secret `ServerEntry` to a user, all players must call `doAllRevealState`  with the followin parameters:



`revealEntries` - an Array of RevealEntry elsements
{{{
class RevealEntry{var key:String, var userIds:Array/*int*/ = null, var depth:int = 1;}
}}}
`key` - the key of the `ServerEntry` to reveal
`userIds` - an array of user ids to reveal the `ServerEntry` to
`depth` - in case depth is greater then 1 the value of the revealed ServerState is counted as a pointer 
to the next ServerEntry

for example if you send doAllRevealState(RevealEntry.create("guess_7", null , 2))

and the server has a `ServerEntry` with the key "guess_7"  with the value "Wrong_Guess" then
instead of getting the `ServerEntry` with the key "guess_7"
you will get a `ServerEntry` with the key "Wrong_Guess".

the bigger the number in the depth the more times a pointer will be followed

*a pointer `ServerEntry` value must be a String.

the revealed ServerEntry array will be sent to all the users by a gotStateChangedEvent
