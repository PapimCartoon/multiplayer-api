To reveal a secret ServerEntry to a user, all players must call ` doAllRevealState`  with the same exact parameters.

Each players must send an Array where each element is of type RevealEntry.
to create a RevealEntry you must call its static create function
RevealEntry.create(key:String, userIds:Array= null , depth:int = 1)
key - the name of the key to reveal
userIds - an array of users to reveal the ServerState to,if null reveals ServerEntry to all users
depth - in case depth is greater then 1 the value of the revealed ServerState is counted as a pointer 
to the next ServerEntry

for example if you send doAllRevealState(RevealEntry.create("guess_7", null , 2))
and "guess_7" ServerEntry has the String value of "Wrong_Guess" then
instead of getting the ServerEntry with the key "guess_7"
you will get a ServerEntry with the key "Wrong_Guess".

the bigger the number in the depth the more times a pointer will be followed
A pointer value must be a String.

the revealed ServerEntry array will be sent to all the users by a gotStateChangedEvent
