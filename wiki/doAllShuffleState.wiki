#summary shuffles a given set of keys

{{{
doAllShuffleState(keys:Array/*String*/)
}}}

Some of the games developed need to have the ability to shuffle values,games such as
poker,domino,puzzles and many many more.

to do a shuffle you must call `doAllShuffleState` which will shuffles certein ServerEntries between themselves
for example: one player stores all the cards needed for a game on the server,each card in a diffrent `ServerEntry`
and then all the users call `doAllShuffleState` on the keys of the ServerEntries with the cards.

this function recives the following parameter

- `keys` - an Array of keys already stored on the server.

after the shuffle all the ServerEntires shuffled will become secret to everyone
and the storedByUserId of all the serverEntries will be set to -1,to reflect the fact that they were indeed shuffled by the server.
