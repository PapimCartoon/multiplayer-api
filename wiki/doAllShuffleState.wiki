#summary shuffles a given set of keys

{{{
doAllShuffleState(keys:Array/*String*/)
}}}

Some of the games developed need to have the ability to shuffle values,games such as
poker,domino,puzzles and many many more.

this function recives an Array of keys already stored on the server,and shuffles them between themselves
for example: one player stores all the cards needed for a game on the server,each card diffrent ServerEntry
and then all the users call doAllShuffleState on the keys of the ServerEntries with the cards.

after the shuffle all the ServerEntires shuffled will become secret to everyone
and the storedByUserId of all the serverEntries will be set to -1,to reflect the fact that they were indeed shuffled by the server.
