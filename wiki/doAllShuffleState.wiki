#summary shuffles a given set of keys

{{{
doAllShuffleState(keys:Array/*Object*/)
}}}

=== Description ===

Call this function to shuffle a set of server entries represented by the keys you send

This function will trigger a [gotStateChanged]

For more information about storing information go to [MatchState].

=== Parameters ===

keys - an Array of Objects each representing a key to be shuffled by the server.


=== Triggered gotStateChange on users ===

The players will get an Array of server entries corresponding to the keys sent
with each having a value of null and storedByUserId of -1


===Example===

all players store the cards needed for a game of Poker using a [doAllStoreState] on the server,

each card in a different [UserEntry],

and then all the users call `doAllShuffleState` on the keys of the stored cards,

the `doAllShuffleState` function will shuffle the cards between themselves and turn the server entries that were stored and shuffled by the users into secret ones.


=== Why should I use this? ===


Some games that are developed need to have the ability to shuffle values.
A single player cannot be trusted to shuffle the values as he may be a hacker, and therefore 
we must do the shuffle on the server.
