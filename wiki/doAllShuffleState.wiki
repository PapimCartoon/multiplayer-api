#summary shuffles a given set of keys

{{{
doAllShuffleState(keys:Array/*String*/)
}}}

Some games that are developed need to have the ability to shuffle values.
 Games such as:  Poker, Domino, Hearts, The Clue, puzzles and many more.

To do a shuffle you must call `doAllShuffleState` which will shuffles certain serverEntries between themselves.
For example: all players store the cards needed for a game of Poker using a [doAllStoreState] on the server, each card in a different `ServerEntry`, and then all the users call `doAllShuffleState` on the keys of the serverEntries with the cards, the `doAllShuffleState` function will shuffle the cards between themselves and turn the server entries that were stored and shuffled by the users into secret ones.

This function receives the following parameter:
 `keys` - an Array of keys already stored on the server.
After the shuffle all the serverEntires shuffled will become secret to everyone, and the storedByUserId of all the serverEntries will be set to -1, to reflect the fact that they were indeed shuffled by the server.
