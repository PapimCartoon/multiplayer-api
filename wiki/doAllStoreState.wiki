#summary Storing data that needs to be unanimous

{{{
doAllStoreState(userEntries:Array/*UserEntry*/)
}}}

=== Description ===

Call this function to store values the entire set of user may reach using calculations,
like who's turn it is or the cards a deck of cards needs to hold.

This function will trigger a [gotStateChanged]

For more information about storing information go to [MatchState].

=== Parameters ===

userEntries - an Array of [UserEntry] elements to be stored by all the game users.

=== Triggered gotStateChange on users ===

An array of [ServerEntry] elements, each representing a [UserEntry] stored,
all with storedByUserId of -1


=== Example ===

One of the players threw a dart at a certain vector,

first the player stores the values of his shot,

and then all the players make the calculation,

eventually they all call `doAllStoreState` and save the score of the shot.

If one of the players claims the outcome is different than the other player/s,

then the data will be sent to a jury which will decide who is cheating.


=== Why should I use this? ===

This function is used to prevent hacking,

every time you need to store a state which will give a unanimous answer,

Use this function to store values you want the entire set of players to agree upon.
