#summary used to store data on calculators

{{{
doAllStoreStateCalculation(userEntries:Array/*UserEntry*/)
}}}


=== Description ===

Call this function from a [gotRequestStateCalculation] to transferred the data from the calculator to the game's 
players.

This function will trigger a [gotStateChanged]

For more information about storing information go to [MatchState].

=== Triggered gotStateChange on users ===

userEntries - an Array of [UserEntry] elements, containing the data that will be sent to the users 
via a [gotStateStateChange] callback.

=== Example ===

lets suppose this is a mine sweeper calculator.
we expect a random number stored by the server via a [doAllRequestRandomState]

{{{
override public function gotRequestStateCalculation(serverEntries:Array):void
{
	/*
	check if the serverEntries received from  the users are legal
	do whatever calculations needed 
	and then store them using 
	*/
	if (serverEntry.storedByUserId != -1) doAllFoundHacker(serverEntry.storedByUserId,"If the storedByUserId is different from -1,then this was not saved by the server and player which saved it there probably broke protocol");
	doAllStoreStateCalculation(createdUserEntries);
}
}}}



=== Why should I use this? ===



When the calculator is finished with the data calculations he was given, he cannot simply use [doStoreState] to commit the calculations he has made,

Because he is not an active player/viewer in the game.

Therefore the calculator will use a special function called `doAllStoreStateCalculation` which acts similarly to the [doAllStoreState] function,

Only instead of saving the game data into the calculator server state, the calculator saves it into the game state of the players which called the [doAllRequestStateCalculation].
