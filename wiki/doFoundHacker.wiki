#summary Call it when you a player sent an illegal message

{{{
do_found_hacker(user_id:int, error_description:String)
}}}

In [ClientGameAPI] all the logic is on the client side,
therefore the players themselves should check 
that the other players make only legal moves.

Both players and viewers should call `do_found_hacker`
in case of a protocol error.

Consider a game with two players: X and Y.
Suppose that player Y stored an illegal match state.
Then player X should call `do_found_hacker(Y,description)`.
The server will randomly pick a jury that will judge whether
player X or player Y is the hacker.

The jury is a set of users that are playing in another game.
The server will pass to the jury the match state
and then the final message that caused player X to call `do_found_hacker`.
If all members of the jury called `do_found_hacker`,
then the server decides that player Y is a hacker.
If no member of the jury called `do_found_hacker`
then the server decides that player X is a hacker (that falsely reported on player Y).
If the jury is in disagreement, then this is a bug of the game developer,
and the the game is canceled.
