#summary Call it to store/update/delete you match state

{{{
doStoreState(userEntries:Array/*UserEntry*/)
gotStateChanged(serverEntries:Array/*ServerEntry*/)
}}}

Use `doStoreState` to store match state on the server.
Both players and viewers can store match state, and only when the match is in progress.
However, a viewer cannot override a stored `key`, whereas players can use the same key-space.
When the match ends, the state is cleared.

The container promises to update the match state atomically, i.e., either to insert _all_ the entries, or not to insert any.
Atomicity is important in rare cases where the player disconnects in the middle of sending a network packet.
With the atomicity guarantee, the match state should always be consistent.

The match state is given to new viewers and new players in [gotMatchStarted].

To delete a key from the map, pass a value of null.

_Important note_:
You can save user Ids in the match state, but do not save user Info in the match state.
The reason is that a viewer may replace another player 
(e.g., if one player disconnects, then a viewer may replace him).
In such a case, the server will reuse the same userId for the viewer, and it will call [gotUserInfo] with the viewer information.

To call a `doStoreState` function, you must send her the following parameter:
`userEntries` - an Array of [UserEntry] elements

The server maintains a memory, that is a mapping from keys to values, in addition to some extra information for each key (such as storedByUserId, visibleToUserIds, and changedTimeInMilliSeconds).

Formally, the memory is a dictionary denoted `MATCH_STATE` that maps each `key` to an object with fields `storedByUserId`, `value`, and `visibleToUserIds`:
{{{
MATCH_STATE[key] = {storedByUserId:int, value:Object,visibleToUserIds:Array/*int*/}
}}}
`storedByUserId` - `storedByUserId`   may be -1 for [doAllShuffleState], [doAllRequestStateCalculation] and [doAllStoreState] which are all functions that are not stored by the users playing the game.
`value` - an arbitrary object.
`visibleToUserIds` - used to show which users can view the value, null means everyone, blank Array means no one. 
Users in `visibleToUserIds` will get the `value` when the server calls `gotStateChanged` 
(Other users will get a `null` value) 

Next we will explain what the server does for each operation.

{{{
doStoreState(userEntries:Array/*UserEntry*/)
DOES ON EACH [UserEntry] IN ` userEntries`:
MATCH_STATE[entry.key] = {myUserId,  entry.value,   entry.isSecret,  entry.isSecret ? [myUserId] : [] }
}}}

Whenever a user updates `MATCH_STATE`, then all users get the callback `gotStateChanged`.
_However_, some of them will get `null` values (instead of the real `value` that was written), according to the ` visibleToUserIds` Array.
