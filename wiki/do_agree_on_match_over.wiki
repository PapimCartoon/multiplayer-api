#summary Call it to end the match. The match will be over when all players called it

{{{
do_agree_on_match_over(user_ids:Array/*int*/, scores:Array/*int*/, pot_percentages:Array/*int*/)
}}}

To end a match, all players must call `do_agree_on_match_over` with the same exact parameters.

`user_ids` is the set of the users that end the match.
In the common scenario, `user_ids` contains all the players in the match.
However, it is possible that only a subset of the players end the match (but in any case, all players must call `do_agree_on_match_over`).

`scores` determines the score of each of the users ending the match.
The user with the highest score is the winner, and if all scores are identical than we have a tie.

`pot_percentages` determines how the stake (or betting pot) should be divided among the players.
If `pot_percentages` is null, then the users in `user_ids` should get their stakes back (e.g., if the game was tied).
Otherwise, `pot_percentages[i]` contains a number between 0 and 100, 
that represents the percentage of the pot that user `user_ids[i]` should receive.

For example, suppose you have 3 players with user_ids=41, 42, 43. 
Suppose user_id=42 ended the match with score 90, and he should get 20% of the pot.
Then all the players (users 41, 42, 43) should call:
{{{
  do_agree_on_match_over([42], [90], [20])
}}}
Now users 41 and 43 continue to play, 
and the match is over with the score=100 to user_id=41, and score=10 to user_id=43,
and you wish to give 90% of the pot to user 41.
Then all players (users 41 and 43) should call:
{{{
  do_agree_on_match_over([41,43], [100,10], [90, 10])
}}}
