#summary Call it when you have to cancel the game due to an unrecoverable error

{{{
do_client_protocol_error_with_description(error_description:String)
}}}

[ClientGameAPI] is inherently insecure, because all the logic is on the client side.
In case of a protocol error (e.g., one of the players makes an illegal move),
you should call  `do_client_protocol_error_with_description`.
The match will be canceled and the stakes will be returned back to the current players;
players that already finished playing before the error are not affected.

In the common scenario all the players will get their stakes back.
This is always the case of the number of players is 2.
However, there might be a rare scenario in games with more than 2 players, in which some of the players have already ended the match.
If there are players that finished playing before the call to `do_client_protocol_error_with_description`
the remaining pot will be divided among the current players.


In [SecureClientGameAPI], if the jury calls `do_client_protocol_error_with_description`,
then the user that sent the last message loses and is thrown out.
