#summary The juror decides who has the turn

{{{
do_juror_set_turn(turn_of_player_id:int)
}}}

In [ClientGameAPI], a player had to call [do_start_my_turn] and [do_end_my_turn].
In [SecureClientGameAPI], only the juror can call [do_juror_set_turn] to start or end the turn of a certain user.

`turn_of_player_id` is either -1 to end the current turn, or the user_id of one the players.
