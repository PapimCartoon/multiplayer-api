#summary Call it to send a message to a given set of users

{{{
do_send_message(to_user_ids:Array/*int*/, value:Object)
}}}

To send a message to set of users, call `do_send_message`.

`to_user_ids` is the set of users that should receive the message.
If `to_user_ids`=null, then the message is sent to all users (both players and viewers).
Otherwise, the command will be sent to the users in `to_user_ids`.

Note the difference between `do_store_match_state` and `do_send_message` [Match_state_vs_messages here]
