#summary Call it to set a timer on the server (similar to setTimeout in AS)

{{{
do_set_timer(in_seconds:int, entry:Entry)
got_timer(in_seconds:int, user_entry:UserEntry)
}}}

When a user calls `do_set_timer`, the server will call `got_timer` on *all* users after `in_seconds` seconds passed.
After the user disconnects, his timers are be canceled.
You can have at most 100 concurrent timers (i.e., timers that have not yet ticked/expired).

If the same key is used by the same user, then the old timer is canceled.
Use a negative `in_seconds` to cancel an old timer (use the same key).
Note that different users can use the same keys without interference.
