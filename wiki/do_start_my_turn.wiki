Some of the games developed are turn-based, i.e., the game proceeds in turns where in each given moment only
one player has the current turn. 
For example, Chess or Poker are turn-based games.
In contrast, Soccer is a real-time game where both players send commands to the server simultenously.
Turn-based games may be played in turns using emails or other means.
For example, in a game of Chess, one player may make a turn, then the next player will get an email notification
and he may make the next turn, and so forth.

Turn-based games may use special functions to set who has the current turn, and who should play next.
The server has a single player that currently has the turn, or null if no one has the turn.
When no one has the turn, then some player may call `do_start_my_turn`,
and the server will call `got_start_turn_of`.
That player may later call `do_end_my_turn`,
and the server will call `got_end_turn_of` (and then no one has the turn).

`next_turn_of_player_ids` are the players that may play next.
If `next_turn_of_player_ids` is empty, then any player may call `do_start_my_turn`.
Otherwise, only a player in `next_turn_of_player_ids` may later call `do_start_my_turn`.

The reason behind `next_turn_of_player_ids` is for email-based games,
where only one player connects, makes a move, ends his turn, 
and the platform notifies the players in `next_turn_of_player_ids` that they can make their next move.


The Come2Play platform performs a check that an opponent should start his turn within a certain period of time (taking into account the network round trip time). Currently a player should start his turn within 10 seconds of getting `got_end_turn_of`. This will make sure that a turn-based game will not enter stagnation.
