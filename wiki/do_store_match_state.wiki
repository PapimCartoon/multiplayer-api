#summary Call it to store/update/delete you match state

{{{
do_store_match_state(key:String, value:Object)
got_stored_match_state(user_ids:Array/*int*/, keys:Array/*String*/, values:Array/*Object*/)
}}}

Use `do_store_match_state` to store match state on the server.
Both players and viewers can store match state, and only when the match is in progress.
However, a viewer cannot override someone elses `key`, whereas players can use the same key-space.
When the match ends, the state is cleared.

The match state is given to new viewers and new players before any other broadcast is sent to them.

To avoid running out of memory on the server,
the number of keys is limited to 1000,
and the total memory of the map is limited to 100KB.

To delete a key from the map, pass a value of null or ''.

Note the difference between `do_store_match_state` and `do_send_message` [Match_state_vs_messages here]
