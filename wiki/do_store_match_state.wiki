#summary Call it to store/update/delete you match state

{{{
do_store_match_state(entry:Entry)
got_stored_match_state(user_entry:UserEntry)
}}}

Use `do_store_match_state` to store match state on the server.
Both players and viewers can store match state, and only when the match is in progress.
However, a viewer cannot override someone elses `key`, whereas players can use the same key-space.
When the match ends, the state is cleared.

The match state is given to new viewers and new players in [got_match_started].

To avoid running out of memory on the server,
the number of keys is limited to 1000,
and the total memory of the map is limited to 100KB.

To delete a key from the map, pass a value of null or ''.

_Important note_:
You can save user_ids in the match state, but do not save user_info in the match state.
The reason is that a viewer may replace another player 
(e.g., if one player disconnects, then a viewer may replace him).
In such a case, the server will reuse the same user_id for the viewer,
and it will call `got_user_info` with the viewer information.


Note the difference between `do_store_match_state` and `do_send_message` [Match_state_vs_messages here]
