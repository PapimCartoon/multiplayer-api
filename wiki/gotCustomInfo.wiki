#summary Called to pass general info, e.g., url of a logo for branding your game

{{{
gotCustomInfo(infoEntries:Array/*InfoEntry*/)  
}}}

*gotCustomInfo :* is used to pass parameters to the game.

It gets the following parameter:

*infoEntries :*  an Array of [InfoEntry] elements. 

These are the keys that are currently supported:

1. *`logo_swf_full_url` :*  `logo_swf_full_url` is a full url (starting with `http://`) 
That contains a logo in a flash SWF file of size 100x100 pixels, and it is vector based.

The game should place the logo in various places in the game
(e.g., in every square in a TicTacToe game, or on every Chess piece, etc)
Because the logo is vector based,

it can be placed in a rectangular space of any size,
e.g., if you want to put the logo in a 40x40 space, 
Then modify the logo movie clip (called `logoMovieClip`):
  {{{
  logoMovieClip._xscale = 40;
  logoMovieClip._yscale = 40;
  }}}
  
2. *`seconds_per_move` :* - `seconds_per_move` holds the amount of second's allotted to each move in the game in games where [doAllSetTurn] `milliSecondsInTurn` is set to -1  

3. *`seconds_per_match` :* - `seconds_per_match` holds the amount of seconds allotted to the entire game
