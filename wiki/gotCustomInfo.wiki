#summary Called to pass general info, e.g., url of a logo for branding your game

{{{
gotCustomInfo(entries:Array/*Entry*/)  
}}}

`gotCustomInfo` is used to pass parameters (key-value entries) to the game.
These are the keys that are currently supported:

1. `logo_swf_full_url`
  `logo_swf_full_url` is a full url (starting with `http://`) 
  that contains a logo in a flash SWF file of size 100x100 pixels, and it is vector based.
  The game should place the logo in various places in the game
  (e.g., in every square in a TicTacToe game, or on every Chess piece, etc)
  Because the logo is vector based, it can be placed in a rectangular space of any size,
  e.g., if you want to put the logo in a 40x40 space, 
  then modify the logo the movie clip (called `logoMovieClip`):
  {{{
  logoMovieClip._xscale = 40;
  logoMovieClip._yscale = 40;
  }}}
  

2. `seconds_per_move`

`seconds_per_move` holds the amount of seconds alloted to each move in the game in games where [doAllSetTurn] milliSecondsInTurn is set to -1  

3. `seconds_per_match`

`seconds_per_match` holds the amount of seconds alloted to the entire game
