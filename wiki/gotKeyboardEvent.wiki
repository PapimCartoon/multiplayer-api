#summary Called to pass keyboard down events (see KeyboardEvent)

{{{
gotKeyboardEvent(is_key_down:Boolean, charCode:int, keyCode:int, keyLocation:int, altKey:Boolean, ctrlKey:Boolean, shiftKey:Boolean)
}}}

The container is in charge of capturing keyboard events and passing them to the game.
The game should not listen to keyboard events directly, because
the container may capture some of these events and the game should not respond to them.
For example, if the container has a chat component, and the user is typing in the chat,
then the game should not respond to those key strokes.
However, in AS2 there is no way to selectively listen only to a key strokes within a certain movieclip,
and even in AS3 it is complicated.

Therefore the game should not listen to keyboard events directly,
but instead override `got_keyboard_event` to know about key strokes.
