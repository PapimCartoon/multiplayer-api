#summary Called to pass keyboard down events (see KeyboardEvent)

{{{
gotKeyboardEvent(isKeyDown:Boolean, charCode:int, keyCode:int, keyLocation:int, altKey:Boolean, ctrlKey:Boolean, shiftKey:Boolean)
}}}

=== Description ===

This callback is called every time a keyboard event is made that is relevant to you game,
and not to the chat application or any other feature surrounding your game.

*Important Note*

Your game should not listen to keyboard events directly,
because some of these events may be sent by the container, and your game should not respond to them.

=== Example ===

If I want the game to notify the rest of the users every time I press enter

{{{

override public function gotKeyboardEvent(isKeyDown:Boolean, charCode:int, keyCode:int, keyLocation:int, altKey:Boolean, ctrlKey:Boolean, shiftKey:Boolean):void
{
	if(isKeyDown)
	{
		if(keyCode == Keyboard.SPACE)
		{
			var keyObj:Object = new Object();
			keyObj.userId = MyUserId;
			keyObj.type = "space"
			var userEntry:UserEntry = UserEntry.create(keyObj,true,false);
			var userEntries:Array = new Array();
			userEntries.push(userEntry);
			doStoreState(userEntries);
		}
	}
}
