#summary Called when the match is over

{{{
gotMatchEnded(finishedPlayerIds:Array/*int*/)
}}}

`finishedPlayerIds` contains the `userId`'s of the players that finished playing.
Note that `finishedPlayerIds` may contain only a subset of the players (see the TicTacToe demo for such an example).

`gotMatchEnded` may be called if:
  * The player disconnected, choose to lose, agree with the players that he can quit the game, etc. 
  * All the players called [doAllEndMatch].
