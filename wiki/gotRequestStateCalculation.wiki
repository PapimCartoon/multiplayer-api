{
	/*
	check if the serverEntries received from  the users are legal
	do whatever calculations needed 
	and then store them using 
	*/
	if (serverEntry.storedByUserId != -1) doAllFoundHacker(serverEntry.storedByUserId,"If the storedByUserId is different from -1,then this was not saved by the server and player which saved it there probably broke protocol");
