#summary Called if the script returned illegal output



{{{
got_error_in_script_output(timed_out_url:Array/*String*/, url:String, url_output:String, url_output_headers:String, error_message:String)
}}}

`timed_out_url` includes urls that timed out, i.e., didn't return any output in 2 seconds.
`timed_out_url` may be an empty array.

`error_message` is an error message or a stack trace showing the error.

`url` is the url that returned the erroneous output,
and `url_output` is the erroneous output.
Both `url`, `url_output`, and `url_output_headers` may be null.

For example, in TicTacToe, if a user sends an illegal message to the script, 
then the script may produce illegal output.
When the script produces an illegal output, then:
  * if msg_type=made_move (the user called `do_send_to_script`), then the user that sent that illegal message loses.
  * otherwise, the game is canceled, the match is saved, and all the stakes are returned like in calling `do_client_protocol_error`.

You can see the headers the script returned in `url_output_headers`.
