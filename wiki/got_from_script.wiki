{{{
got_from_script(type:String, from_player_id:user_id, message:String)
}}}
`message` is a string sent from the script to this player/viewer.
See [do_send_to_script].

`type` explains what was the message that was sent to the script:
  * `type=msg_to_new_viewer` : when a viewer joins the game, the server sends him the latest msg_to_new_viewer
  * `type=msg_to_viewer`     : when the script replied with msg_to_viewer
  * `type=msg_to_player`     : when the script replied with msg_to_player 
  * `type=msg_to_all`	     : when the script replied with msg_to_all
  * `type=msg_to_me`	     : when the script replied with msg_to_XXX

`from_player_id` is the user_id of the player that sent the message (using `do_send_to_script`), or -1 in case the message is new_game or load_game or `type`=msg_to_new_viewer.
