#summary Called when the match is over

{{{
got_match_over(player_ids:Array/*int*/)
}}}

`player_ids` contains the `user_id`'s of the players that finished playing.
Note that `player_ids` may contain only a subset of the players.

`got_match_over` may be called if:
  * the user disconnected, choose to lose, agree with the players that he can quit the game, etc. Note that we call got_match_over when a viewer disconnects as well.
  * All the players called do_agree_on_match_over.
