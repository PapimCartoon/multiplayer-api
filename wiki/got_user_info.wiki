#summary Called to pass user specific info, e.g., user name or avatar

{{{
got_user_info(user_id:int, entries:Array/*Entry*/) 
got_user_disconnected(user_id:int)
}}}

`got_user_info` is used to pass user info to the game; 
it will be called for each user that connects (whether that user will be a player or viewer),
and whenever the user info changes (e.g., if the user changed his nick name).

`got_user_disconnected` is called when the user disconnects (again only once).

Important note 1:
The game may not get `got_user_info` for all the `user_ids` in the match state of some game,
because some users may have already disconnected.
For example, imagine a game of poker with 5 players, where 2 players disconnected, and now the game is saved.
When the game is loaded by the remaining 3 players, then the game will get:
 * `got_user_info` for the 3 players that loaded the saved game,
 * `got_match_started` where `all_player_ids` includes the 5 players and `finished_player_ids` is the 2 players that disconnected and `match_state` that includes also the state those 2 players that disconnected
Therefore the game should not _require_ the existence of `user_info` to display the match state,
and if some info is missing, the game should use default values.
The game _might_ still get the info for the 2 players that disconnected, or some generic info, if those users are no longer in the system.

Important note 2:
The container may decide to do a _player switch_,
i.e., replace a player (that disconnected or chose to lose) by a viewer.
In such a case, the container will simply replace the `user_id` of the viewer by the `user_id` of the player,
and will simply call `got_user_info` with the info of the viewer.
Therefore you should not store user info in the match state, see [do_store_match_state].
