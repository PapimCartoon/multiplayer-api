#summary Starting point to reading the wiki

Welcome to the Multiplayer API project!
The Multiplayer API is a bridge between two parties:
  * *Game developers*, that develop a _game_ as a SWF
  * *Websites that host games*, that develop a _container_ that includes the _game_ SWF.
The _game_ and _container_ communicate using a LocalConnection, and thus each can use either AS2 or AS3.


How to use this project:
  * Read the wiki pages, start in the [TableOfContent Table Of Contents] 
  * [http://code.google.com/p/multiplayer-api/downloads/list Download] the emulator, and start developing your game! If you wish to be up-to-date, you can also checkout the latest version from the [http://multiplayer-api.googlecode.com/svn/trunk SVN]
  * Look at the [http://code.google.com/p/multiplayer-api/issues/list issue tracker] to check for future releases, bugs, and requested features.
  * Mailing list: If you join, you will receive emails from codesite-noreply@google.com
  These are the current mailing lists:
    * [http://groups.google.com/group/multiplayer-api Game developers] - game developers who use this API and wish to share their experiences
    * [http://groups.google.com/group/multiplayer-api-developers API and Emulator developers] - programmers who work on extending this API and its Emulator
    * [http://groups.google.com/group/multiplayer-api-svn-commit SVN commits] - those who wish to get notifications on each commit in the SVN
    * [http://groups.google.com/group/multiplayer-api-issue-changes Issue changes] - those who wish to get notifications on each change in an Issue (e.g., if a new issue opens, or an old one being fixed)

How to contribute:
  * Comment on the wiki pages, create issues, request enhancements, reports bugs, etc
  * Join the mailing list, and help other developers with problems
  * Become a project member, and help us write the wiki pages, add new games, create more game tutorials, create videos of using the emulator
  * Become an API or Emulator developer, and help us add features to the emulator

*License note:*
The API and Emulator are open source, and anyone can use, modify, or distribute them, both in open source projects or in commercial projects. Phrased differently, you may develop commercial games using this API, or develop a commercial container for API games; you do not even have to mention you are using this open source API.

The API is open source, and we hope that many companies will endorse it, and game developers will have many places to submit their multiplayer games.
[http://www.come2play.com Come2Play] is a company that freely distribute multiplayer games (as widgets and in social networks) and share the advertising revenue with the game developers.
[http://www.come2play.com Come2Play] officially endorse this API, and has opened sourced its Emulator with the purpose of creating an open source standard for developing multiplayer games that other companies can endorse as well.

[http://www.come2play.com Come2Play] developed a _container_ for games that saves a lot of development time for game developers. 
The _container_ is in charge of:
  * communicating with the gaming server
  * displaying the players and viewers information
  * displaying a common chat area for all users
  * displaying game messages, e.g., if a player disconnects or the match ends
  * allowing the players to bet on the outcome of the game and change the stakes
  * allowing the players to end the match in a tie, to cancel the match, or to save the match
  * handling turn-based games, i.e., games that proceeds in turns where only one player at a time has the turn. The _container_ limits the time per move or per match, displays who has the current turn, how much time he has left to make his move, etc.
